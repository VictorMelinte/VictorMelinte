Hi 👋 My name is Victor Melinte
===============================

Aspiring Data Analyst
---------------------

As a hotel supervisor with over 10 years of experience in hospitality industry and customer service, I have honed my leadership, customer service and organizational skills. Throughout my tenure, I successfully managed teams, resolved guest enquiries and complaints effectively, and ensured smooth operations within the hotel. While I found fulfilment in my role, I began to realize my passion for working with data and uncovering insights to drive decision-making. After a long time, I made the decision to transition into the field of data analysis. I am currently upskilling and preparing myself for this transition through participation in a rigorous Bootcamp Programme. By immersing myself in courses focused on statistical analysis, data visualization and programming languages such as Python and SQL. I am equipping myself with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in a data driven environment. As I embark on this new career path, my future aspirations as a data analyst are driven by a desire to leverage data to inform strategic decision-making and drive business success. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
